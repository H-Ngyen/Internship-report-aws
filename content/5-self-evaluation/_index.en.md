During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam LLC** from **15/09/2025** to **07/12/2025**, I had the valuable opportunity to delve into the practical applications of cloud computing.
The focus of the internship was the **"CarBuyer" project, where I participated in building and deploying a complete multi-tier e-commerce web application on the AWS platform.**

My journey with AWS has been a comprehensive technical development experience, including:
- **Designing network infrastructure (VPC)** with public/private subnet security layers.
- **Working with NoSQL databases (DynamoDB)** and object storage (S3).
- **Building serverless services (Lambda, API Gateway)** to handle asynchronous tasks.
- **Deploying and managing virtual servers (EC2)**, load balancing (ALB), and content delivery (CloudFront).

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to self-evaluate based on the criteria below:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |

| 1 | **Knowledge and Professional Skills** | Industry understanding, applying knowledge to practice, tool proficiency, quality of work | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Learning Ability** | Absorbing new knowledge, learning quickly | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Self-researching, taking on tasks without waiting for instructions | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of Responsibility** | Completing tasks on time, ensuring quality | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
