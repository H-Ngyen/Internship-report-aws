### General Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**
The work environment at AWS is professional, results-oriented, and encourages autonomy. I was provided with sufficient resources and a quiet space to focus on complex technical tasks.

**2. Mentor / Team Admin Support**
My mentor acted as a strategic guide rather than giving detailed instructions. He gave me the final goals of the project and encouraged me to do my own research, debug, and find solutions. This approach was challenging at first, but it helped me grow tremendously in my problem-solving mindset. The admin team was also very prompt in assisting with necessary procedures.

**3. Job-Major Alignment**
The work was not only suitable but also a practical extension of the knowledge about computer networks and distributed systems that I had learned. It connected theoretical concepts (like the OSI model, databases) with real-world services and architectures on the cloud.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
This was a great opportunity for me to understand the "big picture" of a cloud-native application. Instead of just focusing on code, I learned how infrastructure components (networking, storage, compute, database) interact with each other to create a complete, secure, and scalable system.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
The culture here promotes a sense of "ownership". Everyone is responsible for their part but is always willing to share knowledge when needed. The technical discussions, though infrequent, were very deep and of high quality.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**
The flexible work policy helped me balance my studies and the internship. More importantly, having access to an AWS account and being allowed to build a real project was the biggest benefit, providing me with experience that cannot be found in books.

### Other Questions

**What I was most satisfied with:** The moment I successfully debugged a network connection issue between the EC2 instance in the private subnet and the NAT Gateway. At that point, I truly understood how VPC routing, security groups, and network ACLs work together. It was a wonderful "eureka" moment.

**Areas for Improvement:** Currently, I have no suggestions for improvement; the FCJ admin team is doing a great job.

**If you were to recommend it to friends, would you advise them to do an internship here? Why?**
Definitely. I would tell them: "If you want a deep, hands-on experience building secure and scalable cloud infrastructure from scratch, and not just writing code, then this is the place for you."

### Proposals & Wishes

**Future Wishes:** I wish to continue my journey with FCJ after this internship ends. I feel there is still much more I can learn here, and I will continue to strive for that.

**Other Feedback:** I sincerely thank the internship program for giving me a solid technical foundation and a realistic view of the cloud industry. The knowledge and experience from the CarBuyer project will surely be something I will be proud to talk about in the future.
