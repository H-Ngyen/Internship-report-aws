	"description": "",
	"content": "Deploying a Multi-Tier E-commerce Website for Car Sales on AWS 1. Project Summary CarBuyer is an e-commerce website specializing in car sales, built entirely on the AWS Cloud with a Multi-Tier Architecture. The website provides an online shopping experience for customers and an internal management system for employees and administrators.\nCustomers can easily search and view details of car models, book a test drive, and receive automatic confirmation emails immediately after registration. Employees are equipped with comprehensive management tools for products (cars and accessories), appointments, along with the ability to update website content such as news and promotional banners. Administrators have the highest level of authority to manage information and accounts for all employees in the system.\nThe system is designed with a Multi-Tier Architecture on AWS, leveraging managed services to ensure flexible scalability, high security, and cost optimization:\nAmazon EC2 — Runs 2 independent Node.js web services: Customer Service (public subnet) and Admin/Employee Service (private subnet). Amazon VPC — Network isolation with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets across 2 Availability Zones. Amazon DynamoDB — A serverless NoSQL database with 12 tables, auto-scaling on demand. Amazon S3 + CloudFront — Stores product images and delivers them quickly through a global CDN. AWS Lambda + API Gateway — Handles sending email notifications (booking confirmation, password reset) in a serverless model. Application Load Balancer — Intelligently distributes traffic with path-based routing and health checks. 2. Problem and Solution Current Problem The original CarBuyer website was developed with MongoDB and stored data files and images locally, leading to the following issues:\nDifficulty in scaling and backing up the database. No CDN for fast image distribution. Lack of an automated email notification system. Significant effort required for infrastructure and database management. Proposed Solution To address these issues, CarBuyer is being migrated to the AWS Cloud with a Multi-Tier Architecture, making maximum use of Managed Services to reduce operational load and increase performance:\nDynamoDB replaces MongoDB — Serverless database, auto-scaling. S3 + CloudFront — Stores and distributes images via CDN, reducing latency by 60-70%. Lambda + API Gateway — Sends automated emails (booking confirmation, password reset). VPC — Network isolation with public/private subnets. Application Load Balancer — Distributes traffic with path-based routing. EC2 — Runs Node.js/Express.js with PM2 process manager. Benefits \u0026amp; Return on Investment Reduced Operational Costs — Saves 35-40% compared to traditional VPS thanks to managed services. 80% Reduction in Operational Time — No need to manage servers, databases, or backups. Improved Performance — CloudFront CDN reduces latency by up to 60-70%. High Availability — 24/7 system with Multi-AZ deployment. Automatic Scaling — DynamoDB auto-scaling, Lambda serverless. Automated Emails — Lambda sends booking confirmation and password reset emails. Estimated Monthly Cost (excluding Free Tier): ≈ $85.54 USD Annual Cost: ≈ $1,026 USD\n3. System Architecture The system is designed based on the Multi-Tier Architecture model with 3 independent tiers, making it easy to manage, maintain, and scale:\nApplication Tier Node.js/Express.js: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) handles business logic and renders dynamic HTML on the server. Customer Service (Public Subnet): Web service for customers, accessible from the internet. Admin/Employee Service (Private Subnet): Internal management web service, protected by the private subnet. Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic between the 2 services with path-based routing. PM2 Process Manager: Manages and monitors Node.js processes. JWT + Express-session: Authentication and session management. Data Tier Amazon DynamoDB: 12 NoSQL tables for data storage (User, Car, Brand, Color, Style, FuelType, Accessory, AccessoryType, News, Review, Slider, Appointment). Amazon S3: Stores product images, news, and sliders. Amazon CloudFront: CDN for fast image distribution. Integration Tier AWS Lambda: Serverless function for handling email sending (booking confirmation, password reset). Amazon API Gateway: REST API endpoints with API Key authentication. AWS Services Used Category Service Compute \u0026amp; Networking EC2 (2 × t3.micro instances), VPC (2 public + 2 private subnets), Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Application Load Balancer Database \u0026amp; Storage DynamoDB (12 tables), S3 (object storage), CloudFront (CDN) Serverless \u0026amp; Integration Lambda (email service), API Gateway (REST API) Security \u0026amp; Access IAM (roles \u0026amp; policies), Security Groups, VPC Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB) 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases The CarBuyer migration project to AWS goes through 4 main phases:\nArchitecture Research and Design: Research AWS services (VPC, EC2, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, ALB) and design a Multi-Tier architecture suitable for security and scalability requirements. Draw architecture diagrams and identify necessary components.\nCost Calculation and Feasibility Check: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate the costs of services (EC2, ALB, NAT Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, Lambda) to ensure it fits the budget and provides a good return on investment. Evaluate the feasibility of the solution.\nArchitecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization: Refine the architecture (e.g., using VPC Gateway Endpoints for S3/DynamoDB to reduce NAT Gateway costs, choosing DynamoDB on-demand instead of provisioned) to balance performance and cost.\nDevelopment, Testing, Deployment: Build the VPC networking, migrate the database from MongoDB to DynamoDB, develop the Lambda email service, deploy Node.js applications to EC2 with PM2, configure ALB and CloudFront, then perform end-to-end testing and go live.\nTechnical Requirements Application Layer: Node.js/Express.js with SSR, PM2 process manager managing 2 services (Customer and Admin/Employee). Uses JWT + express-session for authentication. Frontend HTML/CSS/JavaScript rendered dynamically from the server.\nAWS Infrastructure: Multi-Tier architecture with VPC (2 public + 2 private subnets across 2 AZs), EC2 t3.micro instances, Application Load Balancer (path-based routing), NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Security Groups, IAM roles/policies.\nData \u0026amp; Storage: DynamoDB (12 NoSQL tables: User, Car, Brand, Color, Style, FuelType, Accessory, AccessoryType, News, Review, Slider, Appointment), S3 (for image storage), CloudFront CDN (for content delivery), VPC Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB).\nServerless Integration: Lambda function (Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP) handles email notifications (booking confirmation, password reset), API Gateway with REST endpoints and API Key authentication.\nDevelopment Tools: AWS SDK (@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb, @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb), AWS CLI, Git, SSH, Nodemailer.\n5. Roadmap \u0026amp; Milestones Month Outcome Month 1 Complete learning AWS fundamentals, design architecture. Finalize VPC networking, IAM setup, DynamoDB tables, S3 + CloudFront Month 2 Finalize SSR application (Node.js), Lambda email service, API Gateway, EC2 deployment, ALB configuration Month 3 Testing, optimization, workshop documentation End of Month 3 Deploy to Production 6. Cost Estimation AWS Service Costs (estimated for 1,000 - 1,500 active users/month, excluding Free Tier) Service Description Monthly Cost (USD) EC2 2 × t3.micro instances (730 hours) $20.44 Application Load Balancer 730 hours + LCU charges $21.32 NAT Gateway 730 hours + data processing (2GB) $43.10 DynamoDB 12 tables, on-demand mode, 1GB storage $0.29 S3 Standard 10GB storage + 25K requests $0.28 CloudFront CDN distribution, 5GB origin transfer $0.10 Lambda Email service (1K requests/month) $0.01 API Gateway REST API (1K requests/month) $0.00 ➡ Total Monthly Cost: ≈ $85.54 USD ➡ Annual Cost: ≈ $1,026 USD\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Risk Impact Probability Cost overruns Medium Low Security vulnerabilities High Medium Performance issues Medium Low Email delivery failures Low Medium Mitigation Solutions:\nSet up CloudWatch billing alerts and AWS Budgets. Apply the principle of least privilege for IAM roles (grant only the minimum necessary permissions). Use restrictive Security Group rules and private subnets. Implement retry logic and error logging in Lambda. CloudFront CDN and DynamoDB auto-scaling for performance. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Outcomes A complete e-commerce platform for car sales with a Multi-Tier architecture. A secure and scalable system with VPC, Security Groups, ALB, CloudFront. Automated email notifications with Lambda and API Gateway. 80% reduction in operational time and 35-40% cost savings compared to traditional VPS. Long-term Value Demonstrates practical skills in Serverless and DevOps. Can be scaled to thousands of users without architectural changes. Serves as a standard AWS architecture template that can be reused for future projects. "

	"content": "General Evaluation 1. Work Environment The work environment at AWS is professional, results-oriented, and encourages autonomy. I was provided with sufficient resources and a quiet space to focus on complex technical tasks.\n2. Mentor / Team Admin Support My mentor acted as a strategic guide rather than giving detailed instructions. He gave me the final goals of the project and encouraged me to do my own research, debug, and find solutions. This approach was challenging at first, but it helped me grow tremendously in my problem-solving mindset. The admin team was also very prompt in assisting with necessary procedures.\n3. Job-Major Alignment The work was not only suitable but also a practical extension of the knowledge about computer networks and distributed systems that I had learned. It connected theoretical concepts (like the OSI model, databases) with real-world services and architectures on the cloud.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities This was a great opportunity for me to understand the \u0026ldquo;big picture\u0026rdquo; of a cloud-native application. Instead of just focusing on code, I learned how infrastructure components (networking, storage, compute, database) interact with each other to create a complete, secure, and scalable system.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit The culture here promotes a sense of \u0026ldquo;ownership\u0026rdquo;. Everyone is responsible for their part but is always willing to share knowledge when needed. The technical discussions, though infrequent, were very deep and of high quality.\n6. Intern Policies / Benefits The flexible work policy helped me balance my studies and the internship. More importantly, having access to an AWS account and being allowed to build a real project was the biggest benefit, providing me with experience that cannot be found in books.\nOther Questions What I was most satisfied with: The moment I successfully debugged a network connection issue between the EC2 instance in the private subnet and the NAT Gateway. At that point, I truly understood how VPC routing, security groups, and network ACLs work together. It was a wonderful \u0026ldquo;eureka\u0026rdquo; moment.\nAreas for Improvement: Currently, I have no suggestions for improvement; the FCJ admin team is doing a great job.\nIf you were to recommend it to friends, would you advise them to do an internship here? Why? Definitely. I would tell them: \u0026ldquo;If you want a deep, hands-on experience building secure and scalable cloud infrastructure from scratch, and not just writing code, then this is the place for you.\u0026rdquo;\nProposals \u0026amp; Wishes Future Wishes: I wish to continue my journey with FCJ after this internship ends. I feel there is still much more I can learn here, and I will continue to strive for that.\nOther Feedback: I sincerely thank the internship program for giving me a solid technical foundation and a realistic view of the cloud industry. The knowledge and experience from the CarBuyer project will surely be something I will be proud to talk about in the future.\n"

Successfully deployed VPC with 2 public + 2 private subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and Route Tables. Set up IAM roles for EC2 and Lambda. Created 12 DynamoDB tables and designed appropriate schemas. Successfully migrated data model from MongoDB to DynamoDB. Completed CarBuyer application with DynamoDB and split into 2 services (Customer and Admin/Employee). Challenges: Needed time to understand the difference between MongoDB (document-based) and DynamoDB (key-value). Splitting the application into 2 independent services required restructuring code and routing. Plan for Next Week: Set up S3, CloudFront, and VPC Gateway Endpoint. Develop Lambda email service with Nodemailer and API Gateway. Deploy 2 services to EC2 and configure Application Load Balancer. Continue writing workshop documentation. "

Modified code of 2 services to integrate with Lambda email service. Successfully deployed Customer and Admin services to EC2 with Node.js and PM2. Configured Application Load Balancer with Target Groups and path-based routing. Fixed some errors after deployment. Continued writing workshop documentation. Challenges: Initially used Amazon SES for SMTP configuration but encountered some limitations, so switched to another SMTP provider. Path-based routing on ALB required precise configuration to correctly route between Customer and Admin services. Encountered some errors after deployment that needed debugging and fixing. Plan for Next Week: Re-test the entire system (Customer, Admin, Lambda email). Fix bugs, optimize, and improve UI/UX. Continue finalizing workshop documentation. "
